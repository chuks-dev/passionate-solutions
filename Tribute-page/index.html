          <h4>HTML Crash Course</h4>
          <p>
            In this crash course I will cram as much about HTML that I can. This
            is meant for absolute beginners. If you are interested in learning
            HTML but know nothing, then you are in the right place. We will be
            creating a cheat sheet with all of the common HTML5 tags,
            attributes, semantic markup, etc. We will not be focusing on CSS in
            this video. The CSS crash course will be released shortly after.

          <h4>CSS Crash Course</h4>
          <p>
            In this video I will cram as much as possible about CSS. We will be looking at styles, selectors, declarations, etc. We will build a CSS cheat sheet that you can keep as a resource and we will also create a basic website layout. We are using CSS3 but mostly the basics. I will be creating an advanced CSS course with animations, etc. I do have a Flexbox in 20 minutes video as well if you want to learn flexbox.
